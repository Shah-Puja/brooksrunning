     			<h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
          <ul class="bold">
            <li>Pain along the achilles tendon during/after activity</li>
            <li>Swelling over the distal 1-3 inches of the Achilles tendon</li>
            <li>Tender to touch</li>
            <li>Pain associated with or when trying to raise up on the toes, or with stretching of the calf/Achilles tendon</li>
            <li>Limited range of motion and stiffness</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>DEFINITIONS</h4>
          <h5>Achilles Tendonitis</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An inflammation of the tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone (calcaneus)</li>
            <li>May be small tears in the tendon from overuse</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Achilles rupture</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Weakening of the collagen fibers of the tendon leading to partial tearing or rupture (complete tear) of the tendon away from the heel</li>
            <li>Rupture noted by inability to raise up on toes or push off with ball of foot in walking</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Tenosynovitis</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Inflammation of the vascular sheath that covers the Achilles tendon</li>
            <li>May even be caused by the shoe counter rubbing on the heel</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>PRIMARY CAUSE</h4>
          <h5>Excessive Pronation</h5>
          <p>Pronation is a normal movement of the foot, that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which helps the body to absorb shock and adapt to different ground surfaces. In analyzing ones gait, first contact is on the heel and outside of the foot; followed by a shift of body weight continuing forward toward the arch and toes. If the foot is weak or tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten more than normal, which is excessive pronation. Flattening of the arch (excessive pronation) places pressure on the arch and stretches the plantar fascia (which supports the arch) and can create inflammation at the attachment on the heel.</p>
          <p>This repetitive, excessive pronation, is the main contributor to many lower extremity, overuse injuries. As the achilles tendon attaches on the back of the heel, and if the the foot is in excessive pronation, there is an increased torque or pull on the tendon, which can cause inflammation.</p>
          <h4>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Tight calf muscles ( the gastroc and/or soleus) and tight achilles tendon.</li>
            <li>Often with increasing age, there is decreasing flexibility</li>
            <li>Increasing the amount or intensity of training — uphill running, or stair climbing</li>
            <li>Flat pronated feet add stress to the soleus and rigid, high arched feet add stress to the gastroc</li>
            <li>Poor support on the inside of a shoe or in the shoe’s foundation/upper can add to the stress on the foot — thus increasing calf stress</li>
            <li>Change in the heel height of one’s shoes (from training shoes to racing flats, heels to flats etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>TREATMENT <span>- ADVICE GIVEN MOST OFTEN IN CURRENT LITERATURE</span></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The 3’s — Stretching, Strengthening, and Supporting, along with ICE and REST have been found to be the simplest and most effective treatment for these injuries</li>
            <li>Stretching of the calf (both gastroc and soleus) muscles and Achilles tendon can help eliminate or prevent many problems with the achilles tendon.</li>
            <li>Strengthening of the calf muscles once the inflammation is gone, can help prevent further injury.</li>
            <li>Avoid hill or stair running until symptoms disappear.</li>
            <li>Supporting the foot with the proper shoes and insoles, can prevent or eliminate the vast majority of increased stresses on the lower extremity.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the heel collar does not dig into the achilles. Look for a cut out of the heel (heel notch)</li>

     			<h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Painful area around the big toe joint which may be red and swollen</li>
            <li>The big toe may be stiff and not want to bend and may be painful</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>DEFINITIONS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>An inflammation of the big toe joint that may cause an enlargement</li>
            <li>A bony protrusion, which is also generally associated with the angling of the big toe toward the smaller toes creating pressure at the first joint of the big toe.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>PRIMARY CAUSE</h4>
          <h5>Heredity</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Generally one does not have a choice if they develop a bunion. If there is not enough arch support or support under the ball of the foot the bunion can become worse</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Excessive Pronation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Pronation is a normal movement of the foot that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which helps the body to absorb shock and adapt to different ground surfaces.</li>

            <li>If the foot is weak or tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten more than normal, which is excessive pronation.</li>
            <li>Flattening of the arch (excessive pronation) places pressure and excessive force on the big toe joint which can cause degenerative changes and inflammation that can irritate the bunion.</li>
            <li>With excessive pronation, increased stresses can be placed on the foot which can further contribute to ankle, knee, hip and low back problems (a chain reaction)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Wearing shoes that do not fit correctly - such as narrow shoes or shoes with pointed toes</li>
            <li>Incorrect foot mechanics - excessive pronation</li>
            <li>Injury or arthritis may eventually increase the bunion.</li>
            <li>Wearing high heeled shoes with pointed or narrow toe box</li>
            <li>Insufficient support in the platform (and/or the inside,arch area) of the shoe being worn, can add to the stress on the foot (bunion).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>TREATMENT <span>- ADVICE MOST OFTEN GIVEN IN CURRENT LITERATURE <br/>The 3 S's - Stretching, Strengthening and Supporting,along with ICE and REST, have been found to be the simplest and most effective treatment for these problems</span></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Stretching of the calf and foot will help to decrease the pressure on the foot.</li>
            <li>Strengthening the ankle and foot, can help reduce pressures on the foot due to overpronation.</li>
            <li>Supporting the foot with proper shoes and insoles, can prevent or eliminate the vast majority of foot related problems. Although bunions and hallux valgus are hereditary, the symptoms can be kept to a minimum by reducing the pressure.</li>
            <li>Wear shoes with a wider toe box</li>
            <li>Stretching of the calf, achilles tendon and foot</li>
            <li>Strengthening of the muscles in the foot</li>

              <h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Pain in area of "ball of foot" </li>
                <li>Burning or tingling sensation in the foot and maybe some numbness </li>
                <li>Pain may be sharp or stbbing </li>
                <li>Cramping may also occur </li>
                <li>No swelling or bumps </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Neuroma </li>
                <li>A bundle of nerve endings whose covering is inflamed </li>
                <li>Occurs when the tissue surrounding a nerve become enlarged - thickened </li>
                <li>Usually a pinching of the third and forth metatarsal bones which compresses a nerve </li>
                <li>Generally occurs in adults and more common in females </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>PRIMARY CAUSE</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Excessive Pronation </li>
                <li>Pronation is a normal   movement of the foot, that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which   helps the body to absorb shock and adapt to different ground surfaces. </li>
                <li>In analyzing ones gait,   first contact is on the heel and outside of the foot; followed by a   shift of body weight continuing forward, toward the arch and toes. </li>
                <li>If the foot is weak or   tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten   more than normal, which is excessive pronation. </li>
                <li>Flattening of the arch   (excessive pronation) places pressure on the foot and can decrease the   metatarsal arch thus increasing the chance of compression on the nerve   creating a neuroma. </li>
                <li>With excessive pronation, increased stresses can be placed on the foot. </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Flat feet </li>
                <li>Wearing of tight, poorly fitting shoes such as pointed high heeled shoes </li>
                <li>Aggravated by prolonged standing </li>
                <li>Increased stress such as kneeling or ladders </li>
                <li>Mechanically there is too much movement of the metatarsals (bones of the foot) </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>The 3 S's - Stretching,   Strengthening and Supporting, along with ICE and REST, have been found   to be the simplest and most effective treatment for most foot and lower   extremity, overuse injuries. </li>
                <li>Stretching of the foot and massage can help to decrease pressure between the toes and metatarsals. </li>
                <li>Strengthening of the foot with the toe curl can help to strengthen the arch. </li>
                <li>Supporting the foot with   the proper shoes and insoles, can help prevent, improve or eliminate   the vast majority of foot problems. </li>
                <li>Make sure the shoe has enough room in the toe box. </li>

                  <li>When using stairs or going up/down hills </li>
                  <li>Worse after prolonged sitting with the knees bent </li>
                  <li>More of a dull ache </li>
                  <li>Cracking or grating in the knee </li>

                <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Softening of the cartilage on the patella (kneecap) </li>
                  <li>Roughening of the   cartilage under the patella caused by the kneecap not tracking properly   (patella does not glide smoothly over the femur/thigh bone) </li>
                  <li>May also be referred to as Chondromalacia Patella </li>
                  <li>One of the most common knee problems in running and other sports (may occur at any age) </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>PRIMARY CAUSES</h4>
                <ul>

                  <li>Pronation is a normal   movement of the foot, that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which   helps the body to absorb shock and adapt to different ground surfaces. </li>
                  <li>In analyzing ones gait,   first contact is on the heel and outside of the foot, followed by a   shift of body weight forward, toward the arch and toes. </li>
                  <li>If the foot is weak or   tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten   more than normal, which is excessive pronation. </li>
                  <li>Flattening of the arch   (excessive pronation) increases stresses on the foot, which can further   contribute to ankle, knee, hip and low back problems (a chain reaction). </li>
                  <li>This repetitive, excessive pronation, is the main contributor to many lower extremity, overuse injuries </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mechanical conditions including wide hips (females) knock knees, patella alta (high patella) and subluxating patella. </li>
                  <li>Over pronation of the foot. </li>
                  <li>Weakness of the quad,   especially the VMO (Vastus Medialis Oblique Muscle) which runs along the   inner aspect of the thigh and connects at the knee </li>
                  <li>Overuse, or an increase in hill running or stair use </li>
                  <li>Too large of a Q-angle   at the knee (this is the angle of quad muscle°s effective pull on the   kneecap) Less than 12 degrees is normal and greater than 15 degrees is   abnormal </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>TREATMENT <span>- ADVICE GIVEN MOST OFTEN IN CURRENT LITERATURE</span></h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>The 3 S's - Supporting,   Stretching, and Strengthening, along with ICE and REST, have been found   to be the simplest and most effective for these injuries. </li>
                  <li>Supporting the foot with   proper shoes and insoles, can prevent or help to eliminate the vast   majority of lower extremity problems due to faulty biomechanics. One of   the easiest and most effective solutions is to add a simple over the   counter insole that provides a forgiving support for both the arch and   heel. </li>
                  <li>Stretching of the hamstring, quad, calf and IT Band with help to decrease pressure at the kneecap. </li>
                  <li>Strengthening of the   quad, especially the VMO (vastus medialis oblique muscle) will help the   kneecap to glide more correctly through the groove at the knee joint. </li>
                  <li>Avoid downhill running or going up/down stairs. </li>
                  <li>Avoid exercises done with the knee bent unless being done as an isometric </li>

              <h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Aching along front of shin, at beginning of or after activity </li>
                <li>Pain along inside (medial) part of lower leg </li>
                <li>Generally develops gradually over weeks or months </li>
                <li>May have swelling in lower leg (in area of pain) </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>DEFINITIONS</h4>
              <h5>Shin Splints</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Common, umbrella term used to identify pain along the shin or front of lower leg. </li>
                <li>More specific names for this condition are based on the area of the pain and the anatomy involved (see below). </li>
                <li>Injury generally occurs as a result of overuse </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Stress Fracture - posterior</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Most often occurring on the tibia (shin bone) and along the bottom third of the lower leg </li>
                <li>Often undetectable on x-ray until 10-14 days after pain starts </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Compartment Syndrome ¬ anterior or posterior</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>The four divisions of muscles   in the lower leg (anterior, lateral, posterior-superficial and deep)   are each covered by thick tissue called fascia that surround the muscles   completely </li>
                <li>During exercise, muscle   volume increases by 20%, increasing pressure within each compartment.   Such pressure can affect blood vessels and nerves in the lower leg   potentially causing pain and damage to tissue and nerves </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Tibial Periostitis - posterior</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>An inflammation of or trauma to the covering of the bone in shin (periostium) </li>
                <li>Over-exertion causes small tears of the muscle from the covering of the bone (periostium) </li>
                <li>Pain is most pronounced in the lower 3rd of the posterior tibia </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome ¬ posterior</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Stress to the muscles along the front medial side of the shin </li>
                <li>Generally occurring along the bottom third of the inside of tibia (shin) </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>PRIMARY CAUSE</h4>
              <ul>

                <li>Pronation is a normal   movement of the foot, that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which   helps the body to absorb and adapt to different ground surfaces. </li>
                <li>In analyzing ones gait,   first contact is on the heel and outside of the foot; followed by a   shift of body weight continuing forward, toward the arch and toes. </li>
                <li>If the foot is weak or   tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten   more than normal, which is excessive pronation. </li>
                <li>Flattening of the arch   (excessive pronation) places pressure on the arch and can cause some   rotation into the lower leg. This repetitive movement can cause overuse   problems from the foot to the back. </li>
                <li>If excessive pronation   occurs from lack of support, then, increased stresses can be placed on   the lower leg and contribute to overuse problems </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Muscular imbalances of lower leg (calf muscles and anterior leg muscles) </li>
                <li>Insufficient shock absorption </li>
                <li>Poor Biomechanics/Improper foot positioning while running </li>
                <li>Worn out or inappropriate shoes (shoes should typically be replaced after 300-500 miles) </li>
                <li>Sudden increase in exercise or running (too much-too soon) </li>
                <li>Incorrect individual training plan </li>
                <li>Flat pronated feet </li>
