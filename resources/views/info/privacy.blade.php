					<p class="br-info">Texas Peak Pty Ltd is committed to observing the 'Australian Privacy Principles' included in the Privacy Act 1988 in respect of our handling of personal information which we obtain as part of our business operations. Personal information is essentially any information or opinion about an individual that is capable of identifying that individual.</p>
					<br />
					<p class="br-info">Our respect for our customers' personal information is paramount. We have policies and procedures to ensure that all personal information, no matter how or from where it is obtained, is handled sensitively, securely, and in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
					<br />
					<p class="br-info">
					This Privacy Policy is intended to provide a general overview of our policies for the handling and management of your personal information and specifically sets out:  <br />
					&bull; matters of which you should be aware of regarding personal information we may collect about you; and <br />

					<p class="br-info">
						The types of personal information we may ask for includes your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. An example of the purpose for which we may require these details is for processing in-store, telephone or online orders. We will collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so, and will limit the personal information we collect to that which is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. Where we collect personal information from third parties, we will take such steps (if any)as are reasonable steps to notify you or otherwise ensure you are aware of the fact that we are collecting that information and the circumstances of its collection.
					We take measures to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse, interference and loss as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We also take measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when it is no longer required by us and this is permitted by law. The types of measures we take vary with the type of information, and how it is collected and stored. These measures include; security measures for access to our systems and electronic security measures, such as firewalls and data encryption on our websites.
					Generally, you have no obligation to provide the personal information we request. However, if you choose to withhold such information we may not be able to provide you with the goods and services that you request or otherwise respond to your query.
